/* 
* 
* Settings: global variables, such as brand colours, configs etc
*
* Tools: mixins and helper functions
*
* Generic: ground zero styles, reset styles such as normalize.css
*
* Elements: a.k.a. Base, unclassed html elements, e.g. headings, lists, tables, this is the last layer that styles tag selectors
*
* Objects:  no cosmetic design patterns. Class only styles from here onwards. Classes here are loosely named and I start doing BEM here 
*
* Components: rich design UI styling. Class names here are more specific. This layer usually has the biggest volume
*
* Themes: if applicable, thematic styles are placed here (e.g. seasonal Christmas theme)
*
* Utilities: utilities, helpers and overrides. !important is often used.
